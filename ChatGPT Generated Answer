Hi Dave,
Thanks for reaching out. It's great to hear from you.
To answer your questions, I've never tried horse riding, but I'd like to try it one day. Moreover, I know it's not very popular in my region as it's not widely accessible. Teenagers here generally enjoy playing video games, sports and socializing with friends.
By the way, I'd like to know more about the present you bought for your friend's birthday. What kind of present did you buy? Did you buy it online? How did you choose it?
I have to go now as I have a lot of work to do. Looking forward to hearing back from you soon.
Best wishes,
Konstantin
