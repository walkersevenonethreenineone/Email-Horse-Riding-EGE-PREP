Hi Dave,
Thanks for writing to me. I'm always glad to hear from you.
Regarding horse riding, I've never tried it, but I've always been curious about it. It's not a very popular hobby in my region, but I've heard it's quite exciting.
As for popular hobbies among teens in my region, playing sports, gaming and listening to music are some of the common ones.
By the way, I'd like to know more about the present you bought for your friend's birthday. What's it for? What kind of present is it? Who is it for?
I have to go now, as I've got lots of homework to do. Keep in touch.
Best wishes,
Konstantin
