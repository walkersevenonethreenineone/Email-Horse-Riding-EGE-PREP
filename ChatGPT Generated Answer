Hi Dave,
Thanks for reaching out. It's great to hear from you.
To answer your questions, I've never tried horse riding so I don't have a personal attitude towards it. However, I know it's not very popular in my region as it's not widely accessible. Teenagers here generally enjoy playing video games, sports and socializing with friends.
By the way, I'd like to know more about the present you bought for your friend's birthday. What is it? Who is it for? And why did you choose it?
I have to go now as I have a lot of work to do. Looking forward to hearing back from you soon.
Best wishes,
Konstantin
