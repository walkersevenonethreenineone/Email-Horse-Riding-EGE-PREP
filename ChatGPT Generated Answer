Hi Dave,
Thanks for writing to me. I'm always glad to get emails from you.
To answer your questions, horse riding is not very popular in my region as there are not many opportunities for it. However, I've heard that it can be a great hobby for some people. In my region, popular hobbies among teens include playing sports, photography, and playing musical instruments.
By the way, I'd like to know more about the present you bought for your friend's birthday. What kind of present did you buy? What was the occasion? How did you choose it?
I have to go now as I've got lots of homework to do. Keep in touch.
Best wishes,
Konstantin
